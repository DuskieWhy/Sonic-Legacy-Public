# FNF - NightmareVision (Pysch engine fork)
Engine originally used for the [Hit Single mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/395039), modifying Psych Engine 0.6.3 to add support for HScript, fix some bugs and overall be easier to use for both unexperienced AND experienced coders.

## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), 4.3.3 should work.

## Compiling:
To compile, you must first complete the steps listed above in *Installation*. Run the command `lime test windows` in your Windows Powershell / CMD, and enjoy!
If you're way too lazy to read all the stuff up in *Installation* (which you should TOTALLY read!), you can do either of these options:
1. Run the *Compile.bat* file contained in the ***projFiles*** folder and it should set all of the libraries required for this engine to compile, then compile.
2. Do this to install the libraries (it will NOT compile the game tho)

```text
haxelib install hmm
haxelib run hmm install
```

### IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THE ASSETS IN THE `embed` FOLDER UNEMBEDDED WHEN COMPILING, COMMENT OUT THE VARIABLES `FINAL_BUILD` AND `EXE_EMBEDDING` IN THE PROJECT.XML!
